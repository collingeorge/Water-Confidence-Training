-----

## Phase 6: Advanced Deep Retrieval and Transit Challenge

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol (Base Version)

1. Execute a controlled entry (head-first or feet-first)
1. Descend to 13 ft with arms clasped behind the lower back until bottom contact
1. Release hands and retrieve the mask using one hand only
1. Perform a 5-second controlled bottom hold while maintaining neutral buoyancy and visual orientation
1. Initiate underwater transit across the pool (~30 ft), keeping arms in a streamlined position except for necessary corrections
1. Upon reaching the opposite end, make clear bilateral foot contact with the pool bottom
1. Execute a strong bottom push-off and continue underwater toward the 5-ft section
1. Surface only when the hand makes contact with the shallow gradient
1. Exit the pool

### Advanced Variant (Executed 12/06/2025)

**Target breath-hold**: 60 seconds with three stationary holds

1. Head-first entry from deck
1. Hands clasped behind back throughout descent
1. Descend to 13 ft, hands clasped
1. Release hands, retrieve mask with one hand, immediately re-clasp
1. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** (13 ft depth)
1. Swim to opposite end along bottom (~30 ft), hands clasped, carrying mask
1. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** at far end (13 ft depth)
1. Ascend to 5-ft section while maintaining hand clasp
1. Swim across 5-ft section to pool end (~20 ft)
1. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** against wall (5 ft depth)
1. Surface only after completing final hold
1. Exit pool

**Notes on Advanced Variant**:

- Total apnea duration: approximately 60 seconds
- Three stationary holds totaling 15 seconds of CO₂ accumulation
- Hands remain clasped except for mask retrieval moment
- Multi-depth transition (13 ft → 5 ft) during single breath-hold
- This variant significantly increases difficulty to 9/10

**Training Focus**: High-difficulty underwater control incorporating depth pressure adaptation, task-specific breath-hold discipline, hydrodynamic efficiency without full arm propulsion, and cognitive precision during CO₂ accumulation. Advanced variant adds extended apnea duration with multiple postural holds requiring sustained composure under progressive hypoxia.

1. Re-enter the pool and perform a second 50-ft freestyle swim, emphasizing pace maintenance under residual oxygen debt
1. Rest 45–60 seconds on deck, then repeat the set

**Training Focus**: Post-apnea cardiovascular load, rapid transition from hypoxic stress to aerobic demand, neuromuscular endurance, and controlled breathing recovery following depth-based workload

-----

1. Immediately re-submerge and continue the remaining underwater transit to the far wall
1. Upon reaching the far end, make clear bilateral foot contact with the pool bottom
1. Execute a single controlled bottom push-off, maintaining hydrodynamic posture
1. Swim underwater toward the 5-ft section until buoyancy assists ascent
1. Surface only when hand contact is made with the shallow gradient
1. Exit the pool without resting on the wall or pausing in the water

### Advanced Variant (Executed 12/06/2025)

**Target breath-hold**: 60 seconds with three stationary holds, NO mid-transit surface breath  
**Equipment**: Safety resistance bands (hands and feet bound for controlled mobility restriction)

**Critical Safety Note**: Bindings used are safety-grade resistance bands that allow immediate release if needed. This is NOT a restrictive binding protocol—bands provide resistance training while maintaining emergency egress capability.

**Protocol**:

1. **Pre-dive setup**: Hands bound behind back with safety bands; feet bound with safety bands
1. **Entry**: Head-first dive from deck
1. **Descent and orientation** (13 ft depth):
- Descend to pool bottom
- Orient body position on bottom
- Locate mask positioned in center of pool
1. **Mask retrieval**:
- Navigate to mask location while bound
- Retrieve mask using teeth only (hands remain bound)
1. **First hold and panic management**:
- **Seated 5-second bottom hold** (13 ft depth) with mask in teeth
- **Panic moment experienced**: Disorientation after grabbing mask while seated
- **Self-management executed**: Recognized panic, verbal self-talk (“calm down”), regained composure
- This demonstrates critical skill: panic recognition and active management under stress
1. **Transit to transfer point**:
- Seal swim (undulation only, limbs bound) across bottom to opposite end
- Navigate to 13ft/5ft transfer section (~30 ft transit)
1. **Second hold**:
- **Seated 5-second bottom hold** at transfer point (13 ft depth)
1. **Depth transition**:
- Bilateral foot contact with bottom
- Execute controlled bottom push-off
- Transfer to 5-ft section while maintaining seal swim technique
1. **Surface**:
- Surface only after reaching 5-ft section
- Mask remains in teeth throughout entire evolution
1. **Exit**: Complete evolution, bands removed safely

**Total Evolution Metrics**:

- **Breath-hold duration**: ~60 seconds
- **Stationary holds**: Two 5-second holds (10 seconds total CO₂ accumulation)
- **Distance covered**: ~30 ft at depth while fully bound
- **Panic management**: One panic episode successfully managed without aborting
- **Difficulty rating**: 9.5/10 (bound retrieval + teeth-only + panic management)

**Key Differences from Phase 6 Advanced Variant**:

- **Full binding throughout**: Hands AND feet bound (Phase 6 uses hand clasp only)
- **Teeth-only retrieval**: Significantly harder than one-handed retrieval
- **Seal swim mechanics**: Requires full-body undulation, not streamlined swimming
- **Included panic moment**: Documents real panic experience and successful management
- **Two holds vs three**: Slightly different hold structure but comparable total CO₂ load

**Critical Training Outcome - Panic Management**:

This evolution is particularly valuable because it included a genuine panic moment:

- **Recognition**: “I panicked slightly to reorient from sitting and grabbing mask”
- **Self-talk**: Verbal calming technique employed
- **Stabilization**: Regained composure before continuing
- **Task completion**: Successfully continued and completed evolution

**This demonstrates the exact skill required in ICU crisis situations**: recognizing emotional/physiological stress response, actively managing it, and continuing task execution. This is MORE valuable than a smooth, panic-free evolution.

**Notes on Advanced Variant**:

- Binding adds significant difficulty to all movement phases
- Teeth-only retrieval requires precise head control and spatial awareness
- Seal swim technique is metabolically expensive, increasing CO₂ load
- Panic management under genuine stress is the highest-value training outcome
- This variant represents maximum safe difficulty for 13-ft pool environment
- Multi-depth navigation while bound requires exceptional body awareness

**Training Focus**: Maximal controlled exertion under mobility restriction; teeth-only task execution requiring fine motor control; seal swim mechanics under metabolic load; panic recognition and active management during genuine stress response; neuromuscular efficiency during bound transit; spatial orientation while disoriented; psychological composure when continuing after panic episode; and evaluable demonstration of stress management rather than stress suppression.
