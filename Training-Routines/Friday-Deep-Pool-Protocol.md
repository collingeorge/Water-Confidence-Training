**Intensity**: 8-9/10 (9/10 when Phases 6 and 8 executed as described)  
**Location**: 13-ft dive pool  
**Supervision**: Certified lifeguard present  
**Duration**: 20–30 minutes

Depth acclimatization, breath discipline, underwater efficiency, and controlled stress exposure within safe physiological limits. Advanced phases include extended multi-hold breath sequences targeting 60+ second apnea duration.

---

## Phase 1: Controlled Depth Cycles (Warm-Up)

**Repetitions**: 4

### Protocol
1. Breath preparation: 20–30 seconds of calm inhalation
2. Controlled descent to 13 ft
3. Floor touch
4. Controlled ascent
5. Surface recovery: 10 seconds

**Training Focus**: Initial CO₂ tolerance, hydrostatic pressure adjustment, diaphragm relaxation

---

## Phase 2: Mask Retrieval Shuttle

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol
1. Place mask on pool bottom
2. Dive to 13 ft and retrieve with one hand
3. Swim underwater 15–20 ft
4. Surface and recover
5. Return on surface and replace mask

**Training Focus**: Motor control and cognitive precision under moderate breath-hold stress

---

## Phase 3: Underwater Streamline Transit

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol
1. Push off wall with streamlined body position
2. Swim underwater 30 ft
3. Surface recovery: 20 seconds

**Training Focus**: Hydrodynamic efficiency, relaxed breath-hold technique, moderate CO₂ loading

---

## Phase 4: Deep-to-Shallow Transition

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol
1. Dive to 13 ft and retrieve mask
2. Swim underwater to the 5-ft section
3. Surface immediately upon reaching shallow gradient

**Training Focus**: Breath discipline during depth exposure and positional awareness during ascent

---

## Phase 5: Surface Conditioning Under Oxygen Debt

**Sets**: 2

### Protocol
1. Immediately after surfacing from depth, swim a 25-ft freestyle sprint
2. Exit pool and perform 10 push-ups
3. Re-enter pool and complete a second 25-ft freestyle swim

**Training Focus**: Cardiovascular recovery, controlled exertion, and metabolic stress handling with full breathing access

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Deep Retrieval and Transit Challenge

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol (Base Version)
1. Execute a controlled entry (head-first or feet-first)
2. Descend to 13 ft with arms clasped behind the lower back until bottom contact
3. Release hands and retrieve the mask using one hand only
4. Perform a 5-second controlled bottom hold while maintaining neutral buoyancy and visual orientation
5. Initiate underwater transit across the pool (~30 ft), keeping arms in a streamlined position except for necessary corrections
6. Upon reaching the opposite end, make clear bilateral foot contact with the pool bottom
7. Execute a strong bottom push-off and continue underwater toward the 5-ft section
8. Surface only when the hand makes contact with the shallow gradient
9. Exit the pool

### Advanced Variant (Executed 12/06/2025)
**Target breath-hold**: 60 seconds with three stationary holds

1. Head-first entry from deck
2. Hands clasped behind back throughout descent
3. Descend to 13 ft, hands clasped
4. Release hands, retrieve mask with one hand, immediately re-clasp
5. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** (13 ft depth)
6. Swim to opposite end along bottom (~30 ft), hands clasped, carrying mask
7. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** at far end (13 ft depth)
8. Ascend to 5-ft section while maintaining hand clasp
9. Swim across 5-ft section to pool end (~20 ft)
10. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** against wall (5 ft depth)
11. Surface only after completing final hold
12. Exit pool

**Notes on Advanced Variant**:
- Total apnea duration: approximately 60 seconds
- Three stationary holds totaling 15 seconds of CO₂ accumulation
- Hands remain clasped except for mask retrieval moment
- Multi-depth transition (13 ft → 5 ft) during single breath-hold
- This variant significantly increases difficulty to 9/10

**Training Focus**: High-difficulty underwater control incorporating depth pressure adaptation, task-specific breath-hold discipline, hydrodynamic efficiency without full arm propulsion, and cognitive precision during CO₂ accumulation. Advanced variant adds extended apnea duration with multiple postural holds requiring sustained composure under progressive hypoxia.

## Phase 7: Post-Apnea High-Load Conditioning

**Sets**: 2

### Protocol
1. Immediately upon surfacing in the shallow section, perform a 50-ft freestyle sprint at maximal controlled intensity
2. Exit the pool and complete 15 push-ups with continuous breathing and strict form
3. Re-enter the pool and perform a second 50-ft freestyle swim, emphasizing pace maintenance under residual oxygen debt
4. Rest 45–60 seconds on deck, then repeat the set

**Training Focus**: Post-apnea cardiovascular load, rapid transition from hypoxic stress to aerobic demand, neuromuscular endurance, and controlled breathing recovery following depth-based workload

---

## Phase 8: Deep-Control Transit Gauntlet (Pass/Fail Final Challenge)

**Attempts**: 1 (pass/fail)

### Protocol (Base Version)
1. Execute a controlled water entry (head-first or feet-first)
2. Descend to 13 ft with arms clasped behind the lower back until bottom contact
3. Release hands and retrieve the mask from the bottom using one hand only
4. Perform a 7–10 second controlled bottom hold, maintaining composure and neutral buoyancy
5. Initiate underwater transit across approximately 30 ft of pool distance using streamlined technique
6. Surface once only at the halfway point and take one controlled breath
7. Immediately re-submerge and continue the remaining underwater transit to the far wall
8. Upon reaching the far end, make clear bilateral foot contact with the pool bottom
9. Execute a single controlled bottom push-off, maintaining hydrodynamic posture
10. Swim underwater toward the 5-ft section until buoyancy assists ascent
11. Surface only when hand contact is made with the shallow gradient
12. Exit the pool without resting on the wall or pausing in the water

### Advanced Variant (Executed 12/06/2025)
**Target breath-hold**: 60 seconds with three stationary holds, NO mid-transit surface breath

This variant follows the same protocol as Phase 6 Advanced Variant:

1. Head-first entry from deck
2. Hands clasped behind back throughout descent
3. Descend to 13 ft, hands clasped
4. Release hands, retrieve mask with one hand, immediately re-clasp
5. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** (13 ft depth)
6. Swim to opposite end along bottom (~30 ft), hands clasped, carrying mask
7. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** at far end (13 ft depth)
8. Ascend to 5-ft section while maintaining hand clasp
9. Swim across 5-ft section to pool end (~20 ft)
10. **Seated 5-second bottom hold** against wall (5 ft depth) - **this is the maximum push point**
11. Surface only after completing final hold
12. Exit pool without wall rest or pause

**Key Difference from Base Version**: 
- No mid-transit surface breath (eliminates step 6-7 from base protocol)
- Continuous breath-hold from entry to final surface
- Three deliberate holds increase CO₂ accumulation significantly
- Final 5-second hold at 5 ft depth is typically where maximum physiological stress is experienced

**Notes on Advanced Variant**:
- This is a more difficult evolution than the base version despite removing the mid-transit breath
- The three holds create sustained CO₂ accumulation that tests psychological limits
- Trainee reported the final 5-second hold as "the only time I knew I had pushed really far, farther than I thought I could"
- Multi-depth navigation under continuous apnea requires sustained spatial awareness
- Difficulty rating: 9/10

**Training Focus**: Maximal controlled exertion under depth pressure; advanced breath discipline WITHOUT guaranteed mid-task airway access; neuromuscular efficiency and spatial orientation during extended apnea with multiple depth transitions; psychological composure during elevated CO₂ load pushing beyond perceived limits; and evaluable, standardized end-state performance under genuine physiological stress.

## SEAL-Style Grading Rubric (Pass/Fail)

All conditions below must be met:

- Descent controlled with no uncontrolled sculling
- Arms remain clasped behind the back until bottom contact

- Bilateral foot contact with far-wall bottom is clear and deliberate
- Bottom push-off is controlled with no vertical loss of posture
- Surface occurs only at the shallow gradient, not before

- Head-first entry executed cleanly
- Hands remain clasped behind back except for mask retrieval moment
- Mask retrieved with one hand, hands immediately re-clasped
- First 5-second hold completed at 13 ft without drift

## Safety Protocol

1. No forced breath-holds; no breath-holds beyond comfort threshold
2. No hyperventilation prior to breath-hold
3. Immediate cessation if lightheadedness, narrowing vision, excessive diaphragm contractions, or panic response occurs
4. Lifeguard must have continuous visual contact during all underwater segments
