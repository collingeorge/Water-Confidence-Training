# Friday Deep Pool Protocol

**Intensity**: 8/10  
**Location**: 13-ft dive pool  
**Supervision**: Certified lifeguard present  
**Duration**: 20–30 minutes

## Purpose

Depth acclimatization, breath discipline, underwater efficiency, and controlled stress exposure within safe physiological limits.

---

## Phase 1: Controlled Depth Cycles (Warm-Up)

**Repetitions**: 4

### Protocol
1. Breath preparation: 20–30 seconds of calm inhalation
2. Controlled descent to 13 ft
3. Floor touch
4. Controlled ascent
5. Surface recovery: 10 seconds

**Training Focus**: Initial CO₂ tolerance, hydrostatic pressure adjustment, diaphragm relaxation

---

## Phase 2: Mask Retrieval Shuttle

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol
1. Place mask on pool bottom
2. Dive to 13 ft and retrieve with one hand
3. Swim underwater 15–20 ft
4. Surface and recover
5. Return on surface and replace mask

**Training Focus**: Motor control and cognitive precision under moderate breath-hold stress

---

## Phase 3: Underwater Streamline Transit

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol
1. Push off wall with streamlined body position
2. Swim underwater 30 ft
3. Surface recovery: 20 seconds

**Training Focus**: Hydrodynamic efficiency, relaxed breath-hold technique, moderate CO₂ loading

---

## Phase 4: Deep-to-Shallow Transition

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol
1. Dive to 13 ft and retrieve mask
2. Swim underwater to the 5-ft section
3. Surface immediately upon reaching shallow gradient

**Training Focus**: Breath discipline during depth exposure and positional awareness during ascent

---

## Phase 5: Surface Conditioning Under Oxygen Debt

**Sets**: 2

### Protocol
1. Immediately after surfacing from depth, swim a 25-ft freestyle sprint
2. Exit pool and perform 10 push-ups
3. Re-enter pool and complete a second 25-ft freestyle swim

**Training Focus**: Cardiovascular recovery, controlled exertion, and metabolic stress handling with full breathing access

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Deep Retrieval and Transit Challenge

**Repetitions**: 3

### Protocol
1. Execute a controlled entry (head-first or feet-first)
2. Descend to 13 ft with arms clasped behind the lower back until bottom contact
3. Release hands and retrieve the mask using one hand only
4. Perform a 5-second controlled bottom hold while maintaining neutral buoyancy and visual orientation
5. Initiate underwater transit across the pool (~30 ft), keeping arms in a streamlined position except for necessary corrections
6. Upon reaching the opposite end, make clear bilateral foot contact with the pool bottom
7. Execute a strong bottom push-off and continue underwater toward the 5-ft section
8. Surface only when the hand makes contact with the shallow gradient
9. Exit the pool

**Training Focus**: High-difficulty underwater control incorporating depth pressure adaptation, task-specific breath-hold discipline, hydrodynamic efficiency without full arm propulsion, and cognitive precision during CO₂ accumulation

---

## Phase 7: Post-Apnea High-Load Conditioning

**Sets**: 2

### Protocol
1. Immediately upon surfacing in the shallow section, perform a 50-ft freestyle sprint at maximal controlled intensity
2. Exit the pool and complete 15 push-ups with continuous breathing and strict form
3. Re-enter the pool and perform a second 50-ft freestyle swim, emphasizing pace maintenance under residual oxygen debt
4. Rest 45–60 seconds on deck, then repeat the set

**Training Focus**: Post-apnea cardiovascular load, rapid transition from hypoxic stress to aerobic demand, neuromuscular endurance, and controlled breathing recovery following depth-based workload

---

## Phase 8: Deep-Control Transit Gauntlet (Pass/Fail Final Challenge)

**Attempts**: 1 (pass/fail)

### Protocol
1. Execute a controlled water entry (head-first or feet-first)
2. Descend to 13 ft with arms clasped behind the lower back until bottom contact
3. Release hands and retrieve the mask from the bottom using one hand only
4. Perform a 7–10 second controlled bottom hold, maintaining composure and neutral buoyancy
5. Initiate underwater transit across approximately 30 ft of pool distance using streamlined technique
6. Surface once only at the halfway point and take one controlled breath
7. Immediately re-submerge and continue the remaining underwater transit to the far wall
8. Upon reaching the far end, make clear bilateral foot contact with the pool bottom
9. Execute a single controlled bottom push-off, maintaining hydrodynamic posture
10. Swim underwater toward the 5-ft section until buoyancy assists ascent
11. Surface only when hand contact is made with the shallow gradient
12. Exit the pool without resting on the wall or pausing in the water

**Training Focus**: Maximal controlled exertion under depth pressure; advanced breath discipline with guaranteed mid-task airway access; neuromuscular efficiency and spatial orientation after sequential depth transitions; psychological composure during elevated CO₂ load; and evaluable, standardized end-state performance

## SEAL-Style Grading Rubric (Pass/Fail)

### PASS (Meets Standard)

All conditions below must be met:

- Descent controlled with no uncontrolled sculling
- Arms remain clasped behind the back until bottom contact
- Mask retrieved cleanly using one hand only
- Bottom hold completed (7–10 seconds) without drift or anxiety signs
- Underwater transit executed with only one surface breath at midpoint
- Hydrodynamic posture maintained during final transit segment
- Bilateral foot contact with far-wall bottom is clear and deliberate
- Bottom push-off is controlled with no vertical loss of posture
- Surface occurs only at the shallow gradient, not before
- Exit is completed without instability, gasping, or visible fatigue compromise

**A pass indicates**: Composure under depth load, discipline under delayed surfacing, aerobic–anaerobic transition control, and tactical swimming efficiency

---

## Safety Protocol

1. No forced breath-holds; no breath-holds beyond comfort threshold
2. No hyperventilation prior to breath-hold
3. Immediate cessation if lightheadedness, narrowing vision, excessive diaphragm contractions, or panic response occurs
4. Lifeguard must have continuous visual contact during all underwater segments
