# BUD/S-Inspired Deep Pool Protocol

**Intensity**: 10/10  
**Location**: 13-ft dive pool  
**Supervision**: Certified lifeguard + safety swimmer mandatory  
**Duration**: 45–60 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: Successful completion of Friday Protocol for 4+ consecutive weeks

## Purpose

Maximum psychological stress tolerance, task saturation under extreme hypoxic load, failure management, and performance maintenance during complete physical exhaustion. Designed to induce controlled failure states for resilience building.

---

## Pre-Workout Brief

**Mental Framework**: You will fail multiple times during this workout. Failure is the training mechanism. The goal is not completion—the goal is learning to continue after failure.

**Safety Boundaries**:
- Two-tap rule: Two rapid taps on any surface = immediate abort
- Buddy visual contact maintained throughout
- No dives if vision tunneling, ringing ears, or involuntary diaphragm spasms present
- 30-second mandatory rest between any repeat attempts after failure

---

## Phase 1: Pool Competency Evolution (PCE) Circuit

**Objective**: Establish baseline competency under fatigue and replicate micro-panic management

**Sets**: 3 continuous circuits, no rest between exercises

### Circuit Components

1. **Bound Drown-Proofing Sequence** (120 seconds)
   - Hands and feet bound with resistance band
   - Bob to bottom (13 ft), push off, surface, breathe
   - Repeat bobs continuously for 120 seconds
   - No wall contact permitted
   - Must complete minimum 12 bobs

2. **Disorientation Recovery Drill** (Critical for panic management training)
   - Blacked-out mask or eyes closed throughout
   - Head-first entry from deck (orientation unknown)
   - Descend to 13 ft (find bottom by feel)
   - Training partner spins you 3-5 rotations on bottom
   - Locate pre-staged object (dive ring) by feel only
   - Orient to "up" through buoyancy awareness
   - Controlled ascent (eyes still closed/blacked)
   - Surface without opening eyes or removing mask
   - Only after surfacing: restore vision and verify location
   - **This replicates your disorientation + self-calming experience**

3. **Extended Clasped-Hand Evolution** (80-second target)
   - Head-first entry from deck
   - Hands clasped behind back throughout entire evolution
   - Descend to 13 ft
   - Retrieve mask with one hand (hands unclasped only for retrieval)
   - Re-clasp hands immediately
   - **Deliberate disorientation moment**: Spin 360° while holding mask
   - Pause for self-assessment: 3-5 seconds (replicate your "calm down" moment)
   - Seated 10-second bottom hold (13 ft) - start hold AFTER regaining orientation
   - Swim to opposite end along bottom (~30 ft), hands clasped
   - Seated 10-second bottom hold (13 ft, far end)
   - Ascend to 5-ft section
   - Swim across 5-ft section to pool end (~20 ft)
   - **Final hold against wall (this is your "push point")**: 12 seconds
   - Surface only after completing final hold
   - Target: 80-90 second total breath-hold with three holds totaling 32 seconds of stationary CO₂ load

4. **Bound Seal Swim with Depth Transition** (Based on your bound capability)
   - Hands and feet bound behind back
   - Feet-first entry (less controlled than head-first)
   - Descend to 13 ft using body undulation only
   - Retrieve mask with teeth
   - Moment of disorientation expected: Allow 3-5 second self-calming pause on bottom
   - Seal swim (undulation only, no limb use) to 13ft/5ft transition wall (~30 ft)
   - Seated 5-second hold at transition point
   - Push off bottom and transfer to 5-ft section
   - Continue seal swim to far end of 5-ft section (~20 ft)
   - Surface only after reaching wall
   - Mask remains in teeth entire evolution

5. **Pool Exit Burpees with Hypoxic Re-Entry** (25 reps)
   - Exit pool without ladder (hands only pull-up)
   - Perform burpee on deck with 180° rotation
   - Take single breath only
   - Head-first dive entry
   - Touch bottom at 13 ft
   - Swim underwater to opposite wall before surfacing
   - Repeat 25 times continuously

**Pass Standard**: Complete all 3 circuits within 40 minutes with zero failed evolutions

**Critical Training Note**: Component 2 (Disorientation Recovery) and the added pauses in Component 3 specifically train the panic-management moment you experienced. The ability to recognize panic onset, self-talk through it, and resume task execution is the most valuable psychological skill in this entire protocol.

**Training Focus**: Extended breath-hold under postural holds pushing toward 90 seconds, deliberate disorientation exposure, panic recognition and management, multi-depth transitions during single apnea, final wall hold replicating your "maximum push" experience

**Training Focus**: Task switching under progressive oxygen debt, fine motor control degradation, cardiovascular pre-fatigue

---

## Phase 2: Harassment Protocol

**Objective**: Maintain performance under active psychological stressors

**Duration**: 10 minutes continuous

### Protocol
1. Lifeguard/training partner creates continuous task interruptions:
   - Random commands: "Bottom now," "Surface sprint," "Mask off," "Breath-hold"
   - No predictable pattern
   - Compliance mandatory within 3 seconds

2. Trainee maintains continuous movement:
   - Treading water in deep end
   - Responding to all commands immediately
   - No rest periods

3. Final 2 minutes: **Harassment Crescendo**
   - Commands every 10-15 seconds
   - "Swim to far wall underwater—STOP—return to start underwater—STOP—push-ups now—STOP—bottom hold 10 seconds"
   - Zero recovery time between tasks

**Pass Standard**: Complete all commands without refusal, safety tap-out, or form breakdown

**Training Focus**: Decision fatigue, compliance under duress, task execution without cognitive processing time

---

## Phase 3: The Fifty-Meter Underwater (5MU)

**Objective**: Maximum breath-hold distance under ideal conditions before adding complexity

**Attempts**: Until consistent distance achieved (minimum 3 attempts)

### Protocol
1. Full 2-minute breath-up period (no hyperventilation)
2. Push off wall, streamlined glide
3. Swim maximum underwater distance in single breath-hold
4. Target: 50 meters (164 ft) minimum
5. Competitive freediving technique permitted
6. Lifeguard tracks with pole, ready for immediate assist

**Pass Standard**: Achieve 50+ meters on at least 2 of 3 attempts, OR establish maximum repeatable distance baseline

**Advanced Challenge** (If 50m achieved easily):
- 75-meter single breath-hold
- OR 50-meter swim with 10-lb weight belt
- OR 50-meter swim while towing rescue dummy

**Fail States**:
- Shallow water blackout indicators (immediate abort)
- Involuntary surfacing before completion
- Uncontrolled ascent rate
- Inconsistent distance across attempts (>20 ft variance suggests form breakdown)

**Training Focus**: Baseline breath-hold capacity measurement, CO₂ tolerance ceiling, psychological comfort with extreme hypoxia, establishing personal physiological limits

---

## Phase 4: Equipment Harassment Evolution

**Objective**: Maintain underwater composure during equipment failures

**Repetitions**: 5 continuous cycles, no rest

### Protocol (Each Cycle)
1. Don mask and fins on pool deck
2. Enter water with giant stride
3. Swim underwater to far wall (30 ft minimum)
4. **AT RANDOM DEPTH**: Training partner removes mask from face
5. Complete remaining distance without mask
6. Surface, recover mask from partner
7. Clear mask underwater without surfacing
8. Swim back to start underwater
9. Exit pool, remove all equipment, perform 20 flutter kicks (4-count)
10. Re-don equipment and repeat

**Escalation Rule**: Each subsequent cycle, the mask is removed earlier in the transit, reducing available "sighted" swimming distance

**Pass Standard**: Complete all 5 cycles without:
- Surfacing during the blind swim segment
- Aborting mid-cycle
- Failing to clear mask properly

**Training Focus**: Panic management during simulated emergency, proprioceptive navigation, task completion during active harassment

---

## Phase 5: The Caterpillar

**Objective**: Breath-hold endurance under sustained work load

**Sets**: 4

### Protocol (Each Set)
1. Head-first entry from deck
2. Descend to pool bottom (13 ft), hands clasped behind back
3. Perform underwater "inchworm" movement with hands clasped:
   - Legs pike up and over
   - Chest-to-bottom movement only
   - Repeat continuously
4. Cover 30 ft of pool bottom distance using only this bound movement
5. Upon reaching far end, hands remain clasped, perform 8 seated rotations (360° spins while seated on bottom)
6. Swim back to start at depth (any technique, hands may be used)
7. Seated 5-second hold on bottom at start position
8. Surface only after completing hold

**Rest Period**: 90 seconds between sets (extended due to longer apnea duration)

**Pass Standard**: Complete all 4 sets without mid-set surfacing

**Target Time**: 70-90 seconds per set underwater

**Fail State**: Surfacing before completing the full sequence = restart that set (maximum 2 restarts per set before moving on)

**Advanced Variant** (If base protocol becomes achievable):
- Add 10-lb weight belt for inchworm segment
- Increase rotations to 12
- Add second 5-second hold at far end before return swim

**Training Focus**: Sustained inefficient movement under breath-hold, CO₂ tolerance during restricted motor patterns, psychological endurance through postural discomfort, multi-hold breath discipline beyond 60 seconds

---

## Phase 6: Task Saturation Drill

**Objective**: Cognitive function maintenance during extreme multi-tasking under hypoxia

**Attempts**: 1 (pass/fail, 2 retry attempts if failed)

### Protocol
1. Memorize 6-digit number shown on deck
2. Descend to 13 ft with dive ring, mask, and fins (carry all three items)
3. Place dive ring on bottom
4. Remove fins and mask, place next to ring in specific configuration (told at start)
5. Perform 10 underwater "jumping jacks" (arms and legs open/close)
6. Re-don mask (do not clear yet)
7. Re-don fins
8. Clear mask while remaining on bottom
9. Retrieve dive ring
10. Push off bottom and swim underwater to 5-ft section
11. Surface and immediately recite the 6-digit number to lifeguard
12. Swim 50 ft freestyle sprint
13. Exit pool and perform max push-ups (minimum 25 to pass)

**Pass Standard**:
- Correct 6-digit number recall
- All tasks completed in sequence without surfacing early
- Minimum 25 push-ups with acceptable form

**Training Focus**: Working memory under hypoxia, sequential task execution, immediate physical output after breath-hold stress

---

## Phase 7: Treading Without Hands

**Objective**: Leg endurance and psychological breaking

**Duration**: Continuous until failure (target: 15 minutes minimum)

### Protocol
1. Tread water in deep end (13 ft)
2. Hands clasped behind head or held out of water
3. No wall contact
4. Training partner calls out random intervals for underwater descents:
   - "Bottom touch" = descend, touch bottom, return to treading
   - "Ten-second hold" = descend, hold on bottom for 10 seconds, return to treading
   - Called approximately every 60-90 seconds

**Pass Standard**: Maintain treading position for minimum 15 minutes with all descent commands completed

**Fail State**: Hands used for propulsion, wall contact, or refusal of descent command

**Training Focus**: Leg endurance under breath-hold interruptions, sustained discomfort tolerance, psychological endurance

---

## Phase 8: The BUD/S Pool Comp Simulation

**Objective**: Pass/fail under maximum stress, maximum complexity, zero forgiveness. Designed to induce at least one panic moment requiring active management.

**Attempts**: 2 maximum (expect first-attempt failure rate >85%)

**Mental Framework**: You will experience panic during this evolution. That's not failure—that's the training mechanism. Your ability to recognize it, self-talk through it, and continue task execution is what's being evaluated.

### Protocol

1. **Breath-up period**: 90 seconds (no hyperventilation)

2. **Sequence begins**:
   
   **PHASE A - Clasped Hand Evolution with Forced Disorientation** (90-100 second target):
   - Head-first entry from deck
   - Hands clasped behind back throughout Phase A
   - Descend to 13 ft, hands clasped
   - Retrieve mask with one hand, immediately re-clasp
   - **Forced disorientation**: Training partner spins you 2-3 full rotations while on bottom
   - **Expected panic window**: This is where disorientation + CO₂ + task complexity converge
   - Allow self-calming pause (no time penalty): recognize panic, verbal self-talk ("calm down, breathe"), regain orientation
   - Seated 12-second bottom hold AFTER regaining composure - this tests whether you can hold AFTER panic
   - Swim to opposite end along bottom (~30 ft), hands clasped, carrying mask
   - Seated 12-second bottom hold at far end
   - Ascend to 5-ft section
   - Swim across 5-ft section (~20 ft), hands clasped
   - **Final wall hold (your maximum push point)**: 15 seconds against wall
   - This is where you discovered your limit—now we push 3 seconds beyond it
   - Surface for ONE controlled breath (3-second max)
   
   **PHASE B - Equipment Harassment Under Residual CO₂** (70-80 second target):
   - Immediately re-submerge (you're starting this phase already compromised)
   - Descend to 13 ft
   - Training partner has moved your mask to random location AND placed false masks/objects
   - Locate correct mask by feel/sight while CO₂ loaded
   - Don mask underwater without clearing (swim blind)
   - Swim blind (fogged mask) to far wall at depth (~30 ft)
   - **Second potential panic window**: Vision impaired, CO₂ high, spatial awareness degraded
   - Allow panic-management pause if needed (recognize, self-talk, continue)
   - Clear mask on far wall while remaining at 13 ft
   - Retrieve pre-staged 15-lb weight belt
   - Don weight belt while on bottom
   - Perform 8 underwater somersaults with weight belt (increased from 6 due to your demonstrated capability)
   - Remove weight belt, place on bottom
   - Hands clasped behind back again
   
   **PHASE C - Final Gauntlet Under Extreme CO₂** (50-60 second target):
   - Push off bottom, hands clasped, ascend to 5 ft
   - **Third potential panic window**: This is your third dive, cumulative CO₂ load is extreme
   - Swim to shallow end, hands clasped
   - Locate dive ring at 5 ft depth
   - Retrieve ring with one hand, re-clasp immediately
   - **Final test**: 8-second hold with ring in hand, hands re-clasped, at 5 ft depth
   - This replicates your "last hold" experience but you're doing it on breath-hold #3
   - Swim to pool edge underwater
   - Surface only when hand touches wall
   
   **PHASE D - Cognitive Function Assessment Under Hypoxia**:
   - Exit pool without ladder (no rest on wall)
   - Training partner begins cognitive testing IMMEDIATELY (no recovery time)
   - Questions asked rapid-fire while standing on deck:
     - "What's 17 × 13?" (must answer within 5 seconds)
     - "Spell 'anesthesiology' backwards" (within 10 seconds)
     - "Count backwards from 100 by 7s, give me 7 numbers" (within 15 seconds)
     - "Recite NATO phonetic alphabet backwards, Zulu to Alpha" (within 30 seconds, no error)
   - Sprint to far end of deck
   - Perform 50 burpees with strict form (chest-to-deck, overhead extension)
   - Return to pool edge
   - Re-enter water immediately
   - Swim 100-meter freestyle at 80% max pace (controlled breathing assessment, not sprint)

3. **Time limit**: 18 minutes from initial entry to final 100m completion

### Pass Standard (ALL must be met)

**Phase A - Clasped Evolution**:
- All three holds completed (12 + 12 + 15 seconds) without drift or hand release
- Self-calming pause executed if needed (demonstrates panic recognition)
- Mask carried entire distance, not dropped
- Only one breath taken at surface, <3 seconds
- Hands remain clasped except for mask retrieval moment
- **Critical**: If panic recognized but evolution continued = this is PASS criterion, not failure

**Phase B - Equipment Harassment**:
- Correct mask located (false decoys ignored)
- Weight belt donned on bottom, not during descent
- All 8 somersaults show complete 360° rotation
- Mask cleared properly while at depth
- Panic-management pause executed if needed without aborting evolution

**Phase C - Final Gauntlet**:
- Hands remain clasped except dive ring retrieval
- 8-second hold with ring completed without surfacing
- No premature surfacing before wall contact
- Exit executed without instability

**Phase D - Cognitive Performance**:
- Math answer correct: 221 (within 5 seconds)
- Spelling correct: y-g-o-l-o-i-s-e-h-t-s-e-n-a (within 10 seconds)
- Counting sequence correct: 100, 93, 86, 79, 72, 65, 58 (within 15 seconds)
- NATO alphabet backwards without error or pause >3 seconds
- All 50 burpees: chest-to-deck, overhead extension, no rest periods
- 100m swim completed without wall rest, controlled breathing maintained

**Overall Performance**:
- Completion within 18-minute window
- Panic moments recognized and managed (not suppressed or denied)
- No safety tap-out
- No task refusal
- Smooth transitions between phases

**Scoring Tiers**:
- **FAIL**: Any criteria missed OR time >18:00 OR panic caused evolution abort
- **PASS**: All criteria met, time <18:00, panic managed if present
- **HONOR GRADUATE**: All criteria met, time <15:00, zero form breaks, cognitive answers within time limits, panic managed without pauses
- **DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE**: All criteria met, time <13:30, perfect form throughout, cognitive answers instantaneous (<3 sec each), no panic experienced OR panic managed so smoothly evolution pace unaffected

**Fail State**: Any single criterion not met = complete failure, must repeat from start

### Panic Management Evaluation

**This evolution is specifically designed to induce panic.** Grading criteria explicitly reward panic recognition and management:

**Panic Recognition (POSITIVE criterion)**:
- Trainee verbalizes or demonstrates awareness of panic onset
- Executes deliberate pause for self-assessment
- Uses self-talk or breathing reset
- Continues evolution after stabilization

**Panic Suppression (NEGATIVE criterion)**:
- Trainee denies panic despite obvious indicators
- Pushes through without acknowledging state
- No stabilization attempt before continuing

**Why This Matters**: In clinical settings, providers who suppress panic make errors. Providers who recognize panic, stabilize, and continue save lives. This evolution trains the latter.

**Training Focus**: Sequential breath-holds totaling 210-240 seconds of underwater time across three phases with cumulative CO₂ load, forced disorientation requiring active panic management, cognitive function under sustained hypoxia (mental math, memory recall post-exhaustion), maintaining fine motor control through cascading fatigue, psychological tolerance of "impossible" multi-phase evolutions, immediate aerobic output after extreme anaerobic stress, **and most critically: training recognition and management of panic rather than suppression or denial**

## Phase 9: Surf Torture (Dry Land Finisher)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

### Protocol
1. Lie in push-up position on pool deck
2. Training partner continuously calls cadence:
   - "Push-up position—DOWN—hold—UP—hold—plank—hold—eight-count bodybuilder—mountain climbers—hold"
3. No rest between movements
4. Cold water periodically poured over trainee (if available)
5. Training partner maintains pressure: "This is nothing compared to what you just did. You're capable of more."

**Pass Standard**: Maintain movement for full 10 minutes without stopping

**Training Focus**: Sustained output after complete exhaustion, psychological endurance during monotonous suffering

---

## Cool Down / Psychological Reset

**Duration**: 5 minutes

1. Easy 100-meter swim (any stroke, any pace)
2. Floating on back, controlled breathing
3. Mental review: What failed? What succeeded? What was learned?
4. Exit pool under own power

---

## Performance Tracking

### Record for Each Session
- Phase completion (yes/no for each)
- First-attempt pass rate on pass/fail evolutions
- Time to failure on endurance holds
- Number of safety tap-outs
- Subjective psychological state (1-10 scale)

### Expected Outcomes
- **Week 1-2**: Multiple failures, especially Phases 6-8
- **Week 3-4**: Completion of Phases 1-5 becomes consistent
- **Week 5-8**: First successful Phase 8 completion
- **Week 9-12**: Consistent full protocol completion

---

## Critical Safety Notes

**THIS PROTOCOL IS DANGEROUS**

1. **Mandatory Safety Requirements**:
   - Certified lifeguard with rescue training
   - Safety swimmer in water at all times
   - Rescue tube immediately accessible
   - Clear abort signals established
   - Emergency action plan reviewed before start

2. **Absolute Abort Criteria**:
   - Vision tunneling or graying out
   - Ringing in ears
   - Involuntary diaphragm contractions
   - Confusion or disorientation
   - Inability to follow commands
   - Any loss of motor control

3. **Medical Clearance Required**:
   - Cardiac screening
   - No history of seizures
   - No history of syncope
   - Current physical fitness clearance

4. **Psychological Considerations**:
   - This protocol induces genuine psychological stress
   - Have a debrief plan with training partner
   - Consider mental health check-ins if training consistently
   - Stop if training becomes obsessive or psychologically harmful

---

## Philosophy

BUD/S pool comp isn't about drowning people—it's about discovering that you can continue functioning when your body is screaming at you to stop. This protocol replicates that discovery in a controlled environment.

You will fail. Repeatedly. That's the point.

The clinical parallel: When a patient is crashing and you're on hour 16 of your shift and every alarm is going off and you can't think straight—you still have to perform. This training teaches you that "I can't" is a psychological state, not a physical one.

---

**Recovery**: Minimum 72 hours before repeating this protocol. This is a weekly AT MOST training session, not a daily practice.

---

*Adapted from documented BUD/S training evolutions. This is an extremely high-risk protocol. Do not attempt without proper supervision, safety infrastructure, and medical clearance.*
